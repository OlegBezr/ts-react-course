  Difference between npm and npx:
  "npx is mostly used to run scripts located in ./node_modules/. bin , but it has a few other uses, including running commands from a specific version of a package, whereas npm is for installing packages themselves. If you're on linux or a mac, type man npx and you'll see the documentation on its uses"
